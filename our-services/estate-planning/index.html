        <h2>Healthcare/Elder Care & Estate Planning</h2>
        <p>Often we do not prepare for Eldercare or Estate Planning until we are in the middle of a crisis. Families scramble to locate important documents including those that indicate their loved one’s wishes, if they have been put into place in advance. If this is not the case, there are specific legal documentations that need to be enacted.</p>
        <p>You or your loved one will need a plan to protect assets and income. Medicare & Medicaid Advisory Group will be there to guide you every step, whether your loved one’s wishes have been established or they need to be put into place.</p>
