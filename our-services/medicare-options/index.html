We will advise on plans that fit your specific needs and budget.

        <br>
        <p>Medicare is made up of 4 coverage components:</p>
        <div class="content__subsection">
            <h3>Part A Hospital Insurance</h3>
            <p>Hospital & Skilled Nursing Facilities (Rehab) stays along with your hospice care needs</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content__subsection">
            <h3>Part B Medical Insurance</h3>
            <p>Physician Visits, Diagnostic Imaging, Physical Therapy, Laboratory Tests, Durable Medical Equipment(DME)</p>
            <p>Note: Medicare only covers 80% of the costs of these services. There are supplemental plans at an additional premium that will cover the 20% balance of the costs and other expenses not covered by Part B. Medicare & Medicaid Advisory Group can advise on the plan that is right for you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content__subsection">
            <h3>Part C Medicare Plans</h3>
            <p>These are not your traditional Medicare plans. These plans are set up as an HMO & Part D plans and have several restrictions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content__subsection">
            <h3>Part D Drug Plans</h3>
            <p>TThese plans are voluntary outpatient drug benefits coverage for people on Medicare that went into effect in 2006. In 2016, nearly 41 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Medicare Part D plans. Those ages 65 and older and those under age 65 with permanent disabilities have access to the Part D drug benefits through private plans approved by the federal government</p>
            <p>Choosing your Part D plan is very important and making an uninformed choice may result in high monthly premiums, annual deductibles, and excessive copays and out-of-pocket cost for drugs not covered. Medicare & Medicaid Advisory Group will guide you in selecting a plan that is right for you, resulting in saving of thousands of dollars annually.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content__subsection">
            <p>Beneficiaries with low incomes and modest assets are eligible for assistance with Part D plan premiums and cost sharing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Medicare & Medicaid Advisory Group has partnered with Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit consumer service organization dedicated to ensuring access to affordable healthcare for adults over 65 and people with disabilities through counseling, advocacy, educational programs, and public policy initiatives.</p>
