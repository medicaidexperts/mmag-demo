        <h2>Full-Time Staff of Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSWs)</h2>
        <p>The Medicare & Medicaid Advisory Group has a full-time staff of caring, professional Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSWs) that will assist, guide, and advocate on your behalf, helping you or your loved one to <strong>successfully obtain Medicare & Medicaid</strong>. Our LMSWS are experts in navigating the health care system.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once a LMSW is assigned to your case they will develop a personalized care plan. The next step is to manage all your long-term care needs by communicating with Medicare & Medicaid agencies and health care professionals. Additionally, they provide weekly family “touch base” calls as an automatic built-in support network. This support is a lifetime service that does not diminish in frequency as time goes on.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our LMSWS are <em>Medicare Minute™ program facilitators</em>, in partnership with the Medicare Rights Center. Medicare Minute™ is a nationwide campaign to bring clarity and empowerment to the disabled and aged by presenting short, timely presentations educating them on matters that affect Medicare beneficiaries on a local level.</p>
