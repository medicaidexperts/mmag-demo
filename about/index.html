                <p class="story__desc">The hospital provided me with no services or guidance on raising a daughter with Down syndrome. I was angry and alone. But I fought the system to make sure Tara was enrolled in all the right schools and provided with right care she needed. Now I help families and patients navigate through the complex government bureaucracy.</p>
