        <p>Did you know that the large majority of family members of those of advanced age and disabilities are caregivers?</p>
        <p>There are almost 44 million caregivers in the US - but many don’t identify as such. But by not identifying as a caregiver, many caregivers deprive themselves of the resources that areavailable to them.</p>
       <p>Although the image conjured with the term ‘caregiver’ is one of a 24-hour aide - the definition is actually a lot more broad than that. A caregiver is someone who takes mom to her doctor’s appointment, helps dad out with his groceries, or stops by an elderly neighbors house to helpthem with some light housekeeping.</p>

            <h2>Did you know:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At least one-third of caregivers struggle financially</li>
                <li>More than two thirds of caregivers say that caregiving affects their jobs - so much so,that those who care for a parent lose an average of $304,000 in wages and benefits</li>
                <li>At least 1 in 4 caregivers are in dire need of a break - but don’t know how to access it.</li>
                <li> The majority of people see caregiving as a ‘labour of love’, leading to feelings of guilt when considering asking for help.</li>
